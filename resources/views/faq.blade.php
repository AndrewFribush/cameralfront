		 		<h4>I'm running for a small office, like County Water Commissioner. Should I use Cameral? Can I afford it?</h4>
		 		<p>Yes. Cameral is specifically targeted to small races! Our unique pricing structure makes us very suitable for small races. And even in races where you only want to mobilize a few hundred people, Cameral can help you keep track of everyone and keep them up to date on your campaign.</p>

		 		<h4>I'm running for a big office, like Senator. Should I use Cameral?</h4>
		 		<p>Yes. While our focus is on smaller offices, we are capable of handling large scale campaigns. We can both help you reach out to a mass electorate and target small communities. While the majority of our clients are small races, we have helped senators in some of the most populous states in the United States.</p>

		 		<h4>I only want to use part of your software, such as the complaince tools. How do I?</h4>
		 		<p>We think that would be a shame, since we really believe in our entire product. But our mission is to help you run, regardless of the use of our software. If you want to use something recurring, simply sign up for the lowest level of service. If there's a specific thing at a higher level, <a href="{{ route('contact') }}">contact us</a> and we can either get you set up or point you to a local expert.</p>

		 		<h4>Which political party do I have to be a part of?</h4>
		 		<p>We are non-partisan and do not favor any party.</p>

		 		<h4>Is there any chance of my data, or my campaign, being hacked or stole by my opponents?</h4>
		 		<p>Not on Cameral's end! We use the the highest level of security software and encrypt nearly everything. Some data is so encrypted that only you have access to it! We couldn't give it away if we wanted to. Your campaign is probably more vulnerable to social engineering than to conventional hacking attacks.</p>

		 		<h4>Do You Have or Endorse Any Political Positions?</h4>
		 		<p>Cameral is for democracy, for participation, for voter turnout, and for low barriers to running for office. We do not endorse any parties or policy positions beyond those principles.</p>

		 		<h4>Do you exclude any groups or have any party restrictions?</h4>
		 		<p>We believe the use of our platform should be open to anyone the country decides is eligible to run. We only exclude those groups that are not eligible to legally run. This includes almost all parties. If you're unsure, <a href="{{ route('contact') }}">contact us</a> or look up your local laws.</p>

		 		<h4>I'm working for a good cause or an important candidate, can I get a discount?</h4>
		 		<p>Unfortunately, most campaign laws count specific discounts as a campaign contribution. In order to avoid the legal implications of that, we do not offer discounts of that kind. We do sometimes have general discounts you can take advantage of! Put yourself on our <a href="{{ route('intake') }}">beta list</a> to find out about them!</p>
